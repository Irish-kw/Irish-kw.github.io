Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values of a particular location form a time series, whose prediction is challenging due to the complicated interactions between numerous factors from meteorological measurements, terrain conditions, and industry and human habitation activities, and their predictions have attracted considerable attention from the deep learning community. Although the deep learning approach for PM2.5 prediction generally has an acceptable accuracy, it has difficulty in PM2.5 anomaly prediction, while mispredictions prevent the authority from issuing proper instructions to reduce the impact on general health. We use extreme value theory (EVT) to formulate the PM2.5 prediction problem with a self-attention-based neural network implementation. EVT-based loss accounts for the rarity of anomalous data, and self-attention captures global information. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model obtains an improved performance of 478% in F1 score and 286% in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over the fully connected network, and 229% in F1 and 148% in MCC over the typical transformer trained with the traditional loss function.
