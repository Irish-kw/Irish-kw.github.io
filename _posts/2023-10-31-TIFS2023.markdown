This paper presents APILI, an innovative approach
to behavior-based malware analysis that utilizes deep learning
to locate the API calls corresponding to discovered malware
techniques in dynamic execution traces. APILI defines mul-
tiple attentions between API calls, resources, and techniques,
incorporating MITRE ATT&CK framework, adversary tactics,
techniques and procedures, through a neural network. We employ
fine-tuned BERT for arguments/resources embedding, SVD for
technique representation, and several design enhancements, in-
cluding layer structure and noise addition, to improve the locating
performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to locate low-level API calls that correspond to high-
level malicious behaviors (that is, techniques). Our evaluation
demonstrates that APILI outperforms other traditional and
machine learning techniques in both technique discovery and
API locating. These results indicate the promising performance
of APILI, thus allowing it to reduce the analysis workload
