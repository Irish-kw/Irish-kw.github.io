In this study, the PumpLinx finite volume method is used to simulate the leakage issues between various blades and the piston gap in a rotary compressor for compressible flow. However, it's not just the gaps between the blades and the piston that can result in refrigerant leakage; the gap between the piston and the cylinder is also considered. The refrigerant used is R410a, and its thermophysical properties are within a 1% error margin when compared to the NIST database. The inlet and outlet pressures are 9 atm and 32 atm, respectively. The inlet temperature is 35 degrees Celsius, the rotation speed is 3450 rpm, and the simulation spans 10 cycles. A fixed gap of 2 μm and 8 μm is assumed between the blades and the piston to simulate the leakage situation, with the gap remaining constant.

The results indicate that when the gap between the blades and the piston is 2 μm, the percentage difference in mass flow between the inlet and outlet per second is 12.075%. When the gap is 8 μm, the difference per second is 12.65%. Moreover, for the 2 μm gap, the discharge valve opens earlier and remains open for a longer duration.
